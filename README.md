# Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a **Data Analysis Dashboard** built with React and TypeScript, offering a simple and interactive interface for visualizing and analyzing data. The dashboard includes various charts (line, bar, pie) and a data table that allows filtering and searching, making it a versatile tool for exploring datasets.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The dashboard is fully responsive, ensuring optimal display across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Charts:** Visualize data with various chart types including line, bar, and pie charts using `Recharts`. The charts provide tooltips and legends for better data interpretation.
- **Search and Filter Functionality:** Easily search through and filter the data table to find specific entries. The filter allows you to narrow down data by categories.
- **Data Summary Cards:** Key metrics such as total revenue, active users, and sales are summarized in cards with trends compared to the previous period.
- **Client-Side Rendering:** The project uses React's `use client` directive for client-side rendering, enhancing user experience by reducing load times and allowing dynamic interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **Recharts**: A composable charting library built on React components.
- **Lucide Icons**: Icon library used for visual elements within the UI.
- **Custom UI Components**: Tailored components for buttons, inputs, cards, tables, and more, enhancing the overall UI/UX.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dxuciv/datanav.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd datawise-dashboard
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

- **Charts:** Navigate through the dashboard to view different data visualizations. The charts dynamically update based on the provided sample data.
- **Search and Filter:** Use the search bar to find specific data entries. The filter dropdown allows you to narrow results by categories.
- **Data Cards:** Observe the summary of key metrics in the data cards, which provide a quick overview of critical statistics.

## Future Enhancements

- **Data Integration:** Expand the dashboard to fetch and display real-time data from an API or database.
- **Advanced Filters:** Introduce more complex filtering options, such as date ranges or multi-category selection.
- **Customizable Charts:** Allow users to customize the chart types, colors, and data ranges displayed.
- **Export Functionality:** Enable exporting charts and tables as images or CSV files for reporting purposes.
